## Risk Assessment

### Current Risks
1. **UI Design Dependency** - Need Figma access to proceed with authentication screens
2. **Firebase Configuration** - Requires project setup before development can continue
3. **ML Kit Integration** - Complexity unknown until implementation begins

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Create placeholder screens if Figma access delayed
2. Set up Firebase project immediately
3. Start with basic ML Kit examples
