## Blockers & Dependencies

### Current Blockers
1. **Figma Design Access** 
   - Impact: Cannot proceed with authentication UI
   - Solution: Need design file or link access
   - Status: Waiting for user

2. **Firebase Project**
   - Impact: Cannot test authentication
   - Solution: Create project and get config files
   - Status: Ready to implement

### Dependencies
- Authentication UI â†’ Figma design
- Firebase integration â†’ Project configuration
- Navigation â†’ Screen structure

## Questions for User

### Design & UI
1. **Figma Access**: Can you share the Figma design file or link?
2. **Design System**: Are there specific colors, fonts, or components defined?
3. **Screen Priority**: Which screens should we implement first?

### Features & Functionality
4. **Authentication**: Do you prefer email/password only, or include social login?
5. **Onboarding**: Should we include a tutorial/walkthrough flow?
6. **Offline Support**: How important is offline functionality?

### Technical Preferences
7. **State Management**: Any preference between Provider and GetX?
8. **Navigation**: Simple navigation or complex nested routes?
9. **Testing**: Unit tests priority level?
